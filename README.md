# open-mobility tutorial

@Liubov Tupikina, Alexey Medvedev

The general goal of our research is to bridge the gap between data science, transport engineering, including city transport analysis, sensing citizens and public transport network planning. 
This tutorial on scientific models of human mobility was presented on Winter Workshop on Complex Systems 2020.


# tutorial structure
Tutorial will have two parts:
More theoretical: models of mobility, statistical modeling
More applied: analysis of data, visualisation with deck.gl, python etc.
At the end of the tutorial you will learn how to produce and analyze open mobility data.
